Hello! I am currently a Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Ph.D. candidate at University of California San Diego, supervised by [Dr. Trey Ideker](https://idekerlab.ucsd.edu/). My research interests lies in developing computational methods for building structurally descriptive and functionally predictive models of human cells. Starting next year, I will join [Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center](https://www.broadinstitute.org/ewsc) at Broad Institute as a postdoctoral fellow.
