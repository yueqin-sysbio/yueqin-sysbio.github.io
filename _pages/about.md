I am currently a Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Ph.D. candidate at University of California San Diego, supervised by [Dr. Trey Ideker](https://idekerlab.ucsd.edu/). My research interests lies in developing computational methods for building structurally descriptive and functionally predictive models of eukaryotic cells.
